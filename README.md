experteers
==========

Develop a database of participants for experiments. The database should allow lab members to acquire and schedule participants.


Many people in the academic field know how hard it is to find volunteers for our experiments. Some univerities have databases for that to send older volunteers invites for new experiments. This project is about finding systems for exactly that approach and if we can't find a good one, it't time to create our own. That's why this is on github. 


This is a short description and rulez of a Participant Database used at the Einhoven University of Technology http://www.bartneck.de/2006/02/20/participant-database/

Technology we shoud use
-----------------------
We should use the newest tech, but not because it is new, more about to learn something new while we create the system.
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) (Maybe Ember.js or backbone.js)
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) (not entirely sure what it does)
* NoSQL database ([mongoDb](http://www.mongodb.org/) or [couchDb](http://couchdb.apache.org/))
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) for patterns and responsive design
* [Plugin List for Bootstrap](http://bootstraphero.com/the-big-badass-list-of-twitter-bootstrap-resources)
* [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) as UI package management system. http://requirejs.org/ could be an alternative
* [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) for do avoid css problems
* [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) Could be a good why to simplify XHR
* [less.css](http://lesscss.org/) for simpler css
* [noBackend](http://nobackend.org/index.html) Instead of using complex Node.js 
* Important Documentation and new Infos can be found at http://www.webplatform.org/ and http://www.html5rocks.com/en/
* jsDay2013 may unveil great news and tool to develop in the rigth way (best practise) http://2013.jsday.it/schedule/
