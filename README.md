==========

Develop a database of participants for experiments. The database should allow lab members to acquire and schedule participants.


Many people in the academic field know how hard it is to find volunteers for our experiments. Some univerities have databases for that to send older volunteers invites for new experiments. This project is about finding systems for exactly that approach and if we can't find a good one, it't time to create our own. That's why this is on github.
